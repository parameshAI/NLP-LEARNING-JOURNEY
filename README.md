# NLP Learning Journey with Hugging Face

## About This Project
Welcome to my AI Learning Journey! This repository documents my experiments with *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* using the Hugging Face transformers library. 

As a B.Sc AI AND ML student, I am exploring how to build real-world applications like translators and chatbots using Python.

##  What's Inside?
I have created pipelines for the following tasks
1. *🎭 Sentiment Analysis:* Detecting if a sentence is Positive or Negative.
2. *🏷️ Zero-Shot Classification:* Classifying text into categories without prior training.
3. *✍️ Text Generation:* Creating human-like text from a prompt (like ChatGPT).
4. *🧩 Mask Filling:* Teaching the AI to predict missing words in a sentence.
5. *🔍 Named Entity Recognition (NER):* Identifying names, locations, and organizations in text.
6. *📝 Summarization:* Shrinking long articles into concise summaries.
7. *🌐 Translation:* Converting English text to Tamil (using Helsinki-NLP models).

## 🛠️Tools Used
* *Python*
* *Hugging Face Transformers*
* *Google Colab*

## 💻How to Run
1.  Open the .ipynb files in this repository.
2.  Click the "Open in Colab" button if available.
3.  Install the necessary libraries:
    python
    !pip install transformers sentencepiece
    
4.  Run the cells to see the magic!
